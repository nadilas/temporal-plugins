# temporal-plugins

Is a PoC repository to explore the possibility for a shared repository
of temporal activity implementations by using plugin.

The first iteration focuses on using third party implementations in golang.

In the PoC there are two examples:
- examples/kv uses a plugin written in golang 
- examples/kv-python uses a plugin written in python exposing its client interface for golang
